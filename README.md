# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Sandbox
A robust Python &amp; Tkinter GUI designed for visualizing and comparing classic graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms, including A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS. The application features a fully interactive grid, allowing users to draw custom obstacles and generate complex mazes to observe algorithm behavior and performance in real-time.
